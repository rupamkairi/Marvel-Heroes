You must have to signup for MARVEL developer account at https://developer.marvel.com/ and have your own public and private keys.\r 2. Then clone this repo, and install npm package by running `cd Marvel-Heroes` and `npm install`. \r 3. Also you may need to install Nodemon package, I prefer globally so run `npm i -g nodemon`. And to run the project `npm start`.\r 4. The `public` directory is the hosted by the `index.js` and node. \r 5. To create and change api consider working in `src` directory, and make the site consider working in `public` directory.",
