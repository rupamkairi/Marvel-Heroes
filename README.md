# Marvel-Heroes

## To developers
If you want to go forward and make something your own...
1. You must have to signup for MARVEL developer account at https://developer.marvel.com/ and have your own public and private keys.
2. Then clone this repo, and install npm package by running `cd Marvel-Heroes` and `npm install`. 
3. Also you may need to install Nodemon package, I prefer globally so run `npm i -g nodemon`. And to run the project `npm start`.
4. The `public` directory is the hosted by the `index.js` and node. 
5. To create and change api consider working in `src` directory, and make the site consider working in `public` directory.

I also could make the docs better but I am a noob in these cases.
